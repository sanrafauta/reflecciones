How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    the windows FC application clearly shows the difference between both versions, which makes the work fast

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    to visualize the changes made, correct the errors quickly, and return to previous versions where the code was easier

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:
	Git:
		save changes for you, you do not need remember to do save the new version
		easy to configure the commits
		designed for programmers
	Google Docs:
		very popular 
		edit documents for many people at the time
    cons:
	Git:
		you can not edit documents or spreadsheets
	Google Docs:
		not designed for programers
		
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because Git is designed for programmers, there could be several files that are part of a single program or proyect

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    it is easy using yhe comand color.auto and find the lines add and deleted

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   I want to be a better programmer and use applications that reduce working time
